        The <cite>Permissions</cite> specification defines common infrastructure for other
        specifications that need to interact with browser permissions. It also defines an API to
        allow web applications to query and be notified of changes to the status of a given
        permission.

        This is a work in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some features in this specification are supported by only one user agent, and as such, are
        marked as <dfn>at risk</dfn>.

        Scope of this document
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document specifies a model for permissions to use powerful features on the Web
        platform and an API to query the current permission state of those features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Current Web APIs have different ways to deal with permissions. For example, the
        [[notifications]] API allows developers to request a permission and check the permission
        status explicitly. Others expose the status to web pages when they try to use the API, like
        the [[Geolocation]] which fails if the permission was not granted without allowing the
        developer to check beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The {{Permissions/query()}} method allows querying the state of a given permission, which a
        developer can then use to make UI decisions within a web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution described in this document is meant to be extensible, but isn't expected to be
        applicable to all the current and future permissions available in the web platform. Working
        Groups that are creating specifications whose permission model doesn't fit in the model
        described in this document should contact the editors by <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues">filing an issue</a>.

        Security and privacy considerations

      <p>
        An adversary could use a <a>permission state</a> as an element in creating a "fingerprint"
        corresponding to an end-user. Although an adversary can already determine the state of a
        permission by actually using the API, that often leads to a permission request UI being
        presented to the end-user (if the permission was not already
        {{PermissionState/"granted"}}). Thus, even though this API doesn't expose new
        fingerprinting information to websites, it makes it easier for an adversary to have
        discreet access to this information. Thus, implementations are encouraged to have an option
        for users to block (globally or selectively) the querying of <a>permission states</a>.

        Relationship to the Permissions Policy specification
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although technically this specification and the Permissions Policy specification
        ([[Permissions-Policy]]) deal with "permissions", each specification serves a distinct
        purpose in the platform. Nevertheless, the two specifications do explicity overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, this specification exclusively concerns itself with [=powerful features=]
        whose access is managed through a user-agent mediated permissions UI (i.e., permissions
        where the user gives express consent before that feature can be used, and where the user
        retains the ability to deny that permission at any time for any reason). These powerful
        features are explicitly identified by this specification's {{PermissionName}} enum.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the Permissions Policy specification allows developers to selectively
        enable and disable [=powerful features=] through a "[=Document/permissions policy=]" (be it
        a HTTP header or a the &lt;{iframe/allow}&gt; attribute). The APIs and features in scope
        for the Permissions Policy specification go beyond those identified in this specification's
        {{PermissionName}} enum (e.g., "sync-xhr" and "gamepad"). In that sense, the Permissions
        Policy subsumes this specification in that Permissions Policy governs wether a feature is
        available at all, independently of this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful feature that has been disabled by the Permissions Policy specification always
        has its permission state reflected as "denied" by this specification. This occurs because
        reading the current permission state relies on [[HTML]]'s "[=allowed to use=]" check, which
        itself calls into the Permissions Policy specification. Important to note here is the
        sharing of permission names across both specifications. Where this specifications has the
        {{PermissionName}} enum, the Permissions Policy specification relies on other
        specifications defining the names of the permissions (e.g., the permission "gamepad" is
        defined in [[Gamepad]], and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it's not possible for a powerful feature to ever become "granted" through any
        means provided by the Permissions Policy specification. The only way that a powerful
        feature can be "granted" is through a user-agent provided permission UI, or by some other
        user agent policy.

              If the descriptor does not have a {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}}, its

              for the {{PermissionName/"camera"}} permission with no
              {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} returns {{PermissionState/"granted"}}, the
              client knows that there will never be a permission prompt for a camera, and if
              {{PermissionState/"denied"}} is returned, it knows that no getUserMedia request for a
              camera will succeed.
            </p>

              If a permission state is present for access to some, but not all, cameras, a query

              only guarantees that the user will not be prompted for permission. There are many

        This example uses the Permissions API to decide whether local news should be shown using
        the Geolocation API or with a button offering to add the feature.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
    const { state } = await navigator.permissions.query({
      name: "geolocation"
    });
    switch (state) {
      case "granted":
        showLocalNewsWithGeolocation();
        break;
      case "prompt":
        showButtonToEnableLocalNews();
        break;
      default:
        // Don't do anything if the permission was denied.
        break;
    }
  </pre>
      <p>
        This example is using the {{PermissionName/"notifications"}} permission for a chat
        application to show a notification button depending on the permission state.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
          function updateNotificationButton(state) {
            const button = document.getElementById("chat-notification-button");
            button.disabled = state === "denied";
          }

          const permission = navigator.permissions.query({
            name: "notifications",
          });

          updateNotificationButton(permission.state);
          permission.addEventListener("change", () =&gt; {
            updateNotificationButton(permission.state);
          });
        </pre>
      <p>
        This example is checking whether the page has the {{PermissionName/"geolocation"}} and the
        {{PermissionName/"notifications"}} permissions using <code>{{Promise}}.all</code>.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
        const queryPromises = ["geolocation", "notifications"].map(name =&gt; {
          return navigator.permissions.query({ name });
        });
        for await (const status of queryPromises) {
          constructor.log(`${status.name}: ${status.state}`);
        }
        </pre>
      <p>
        This example is checking the permission state of the available cameras.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
      const devices = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices();

      // filter on video inputs, and map to query object
      const queries = devices
        .filter(({ kind }) =&gt; kind === "videoinput")
        .map(({ deviceId }) =&gt; ({ name: "camera", deviceId }));

      const promises = queries.map((queryObj) =&gt;
        navigator.permissions.query(queryObj)
      );

      try {
        const results = await Promise.all(promises);
